                <p>This started as a scale writing exercise and ended up becoming one of my favorite test songs. It&apos;s got a light tone and good chemistry between all the bright, cheery sounds. It&apos;s supposed to sound how a windy day feels.</p>

                <p>A song dedicated to and inspired by rainy days. Like most other compositions I make it&apos;s very airy and reverb heavy to help give it an ethereal atmosphere. As rain tends to come and go quickly, so does this. I want it also to simulate losing oneself in their thoughts, how it&apos;s so easy to just let the mind wander and drift away on a dark and moody day. Not exclusively to equally dark thoughts, too.</p>

                <p>I&apos;ve always loved what sounds people attribute to space. Really far off, atmospheric effects that feel as if you&apos;d never reach them, despite hearing them. They create a vast space yet can also hint at infinite adventure and discoveries. I wanted to capture even just a bit of that feeling with this track here.</p>

                <p>This song was always a trial for me. First off to see if I could finish a song, but also to see if I could make an intense electronic piece. It&apos;s unusual for me and was a very fun experiment!</p>

                <p>This was an experiment for combining existing long-form samples in a way that&apos;s cohesive and also catchy. Unfortuantely the source file is gone due to corruption from a data transfer, so this is the &quot;final&quot; version. All the same I'm happy with how it turned out. It taught me a lot of important lessons for mixing, as well as timing!</p>
